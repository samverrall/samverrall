## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### What do I do? ðŸ’»
I work as a Golang developer usaully working on microservices, developing new services and helping to maintain legacy services. I actively write unit tests, utilizing AWS / Docker where I get the opportunity and diving into Kubernetes where I can. Liasing with the front-end teams and writing release documentation. In my own time I build a few personal Golang projects, whilst also keeping up to date on any new tech that excites me!

### What am I working on? ðŸ™Œ
I'm currently building an open source 'invoicing application' - with a current focus of building the API in Golang. [See the repo here](https://github.com/samverrall/invoice-api-service).
