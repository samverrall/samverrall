## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### What do I do? ðŸ’»
I work as a Golang developer currently working on API microservices for horses using the likes on Golang, AWS + Kubernetes and much more.

### What am I working on? ðŸ™Œ
I'm currently building an open source 'Task' web application as a practical demo of Golang microservices. Including a gateway to call through to gRPC, use of the hexagonal architecture pattern and much more. [See the monorepo here](https://github.com/samverrall/go-task-application).
