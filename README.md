## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### What do i do? ðŸ’»
I work as a GoLang develoepr, working on microservices, developing new services and helping to maintain legacy services. Actively writing unit tests, utilizing AWS / Docker where I get the opportunity and diving into Kubernetes where I can. Liasing with the front-end teams and writing release documentation. In my own time I build a few personal GoLang projects, whilst also keeping up to date on any new tech that excites me!

### What am i working on? ðŸ™Œ
Iâ€™m currently working on building a couple of projects, one is an open source CLI tool written with Go called [Go Scan](https://github.com/samverrall/goscan). Go Scan scrapes websites and run's SEO checks directly from your command line - it also has a bunch of other nice features! Feel free to check the repo for more information. The other is a full-stack time management PWA / web app written with Svelte, TypeScript and a TypeORM backend. These are personal projects I try to build and maintain in my own time. Unfortunatly the time management application is currently closed source.
